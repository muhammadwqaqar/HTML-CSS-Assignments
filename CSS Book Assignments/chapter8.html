Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
<br><br>
1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
<br><br>
also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
<br><br>
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem 
  IpsumLorem
