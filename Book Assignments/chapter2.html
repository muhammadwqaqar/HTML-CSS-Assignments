<P>Molly had Been staring out of her window for about an hour.On her desk.lying between the copies of<strong> 
    Nature,New scientist,</strong>and all the other 
scientific jounals her work had appeared in,was a well thumded 
copy of on the road.It had been Molly's favourite book since college
 ,and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she nneeded to be free.
</P>

she had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting a posterwith an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have
nothing better to do"=Although many considered her pionccring,work,unraveling the secrets of the llama<strong> DNA</strong>,to be an outstanding achievement,Molly
did think she had somnthing better to do
